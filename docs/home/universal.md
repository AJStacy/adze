Modern JavaScript frameworks like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [NuxtJS](https://nuxt.com/), and
[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) combine your "back-end" and "front-end" code in the same
location. **Adze is universal** which means it can be executed on the
[server side or the browser side](../getting-started/installation.md) without any extra
considerations. Use it anywhere!
