## Getting Started is Easy

First install Adze from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/adze).

```bash
# npm
npm install -S adze

# pnpm
pnpm add adze
```

Then import it and start writing logs! No other configuration is required.

```typescript
import adze from 'adze';

adze.info('This is an info level log from AdzeJS!');
```
