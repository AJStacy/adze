**Adze supports multiple formatting options** out-of-the-box. Use the [pretty](../reference/formatters.md#pretty-formatter),
human-readable default format, or generate machine-readable logs using the [JSON format](../reference/formatters.md#json-formatter);
or even mix and match both! How you use Adze is up to you.

Adze JSON logs are also compatible with
the [Bunyan CLI](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan?tab=readme-ov-file#cli-usage) so you can take
advantage of its formatting and filtering features!
